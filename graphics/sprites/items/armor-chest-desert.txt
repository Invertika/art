Layers in the XCF file:

Grid: simple grid separating the tiles.
New Layer copy: used for perspective and light source. Can be modded onto the pixels for a more realistic look, or left off.
Helmet: the helmet, obviously.
Frame 7 (80ms) (replace): appears to change only the skull in one frame. Not much use.
Chest: the chest part of the armor set.
Wrists: the gauntlet part of the set.
Gloves: gloves. Can be separate from the gauntlets or bundled together.
Legs: the pants, obviously.
Boots: boots, duh.
Background: the (male) player sprite.
New Layer#1: gray background.
Everything under New Layer#1: doesn't look important.
